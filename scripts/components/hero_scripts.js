// This particular hero section doesn't require complex JavaScript for its core functionality
// (responsiveness is handled by CSS media queries).
// However, you might add JS later for:
// - Dynamic content loading
// - Animations (e.g., parallax scroll effect for the background)
// - Interactive elements within the hero or story cards
// For now, this file can remain empty or contain simple logging.

document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    console.log('Hero section and stories loaded!');
    // Example: You could add an event listener to the button if it were to trigger something more complex than a link.
    const readMoreButton = document.querySelector('.read-more-button');
    if (readMoreButton) {
        readMoreButton.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
            // event.preventDefault(); // Uncomment to prevent default link behavior
            console.log('Read More button clicked!');
            // Add custom JS logic here, e.g., smooth scroll to a section
        });
    }
