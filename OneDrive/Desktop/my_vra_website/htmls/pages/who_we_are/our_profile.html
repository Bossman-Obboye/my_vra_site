                <h2>Our Foundation and Evolution</h2>
                <p>The Volta River Authority (VRA) was established on <strong>April 26, 1961</strong> with the mandate to generate, transmit and distribute electricity under the Volta River Development Act, Act 46 of the Republic of Ghana.</p>
                <p>However, following the promulgation of a major amendment to the Act within the context of the Ghana Government Power Sector Reforms in 2005, the VRA's mandate has now been largely restricted to generation of electricity. This amendment has created an enabling environment to attract Independent Power Producers (IPPs) into the Ghana Energy market.</p>
                <p>The amendment also hived-off the VRA's transmission function into a separate entity designated the Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo), while the distribution agency, the Northern Electricity Department (NED), established in April 1987, also evolved into the Northern Electricity Distribution Company (NEDCo), a wholly-owned standalone subsidiary of the VRA.</p>

                <h3>Ameri Power Plant Relocation</h3>
                <p>In order to ensure reliable plant operations and grid stability, the Government of Ghana and the Authority have relocated the <strong>150MW</strong> of the erstwhile Ameri Power Plant from Aboadze to Anwomaso in the Ashanti Region (with an additional 100MW yet to be relocated).</p>
                <h3>Pwalugu Multipurpose Dam Project</h3>
                <p>His Excellency President of Ghana, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, cut the sod for the Pwalugu Multipurpose Dam Project in November 2019. The project comprises a <strong>60MW hydroelectric power plant, a 50 MW Solar Plant and a 25,000-hectare irrigation scheme</strong>. The power component will improve power supply reliability in the northern part of Ghana. The irrigation scheme, managed by the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority, will increase annual rice and maize production by 117,000 tonnes and 49,000 tonnes, respectively. The dam’s construction will reduce the perennial flooding in the White Volta Basin caused by heavy rainfall in the rainy season and the associated spilling of water from the Bagre Dam in Burkina Faso. VRA has completed preliminary project activities, including the Environmental Impact Assessment and Resettlement Action Plan and the construction of road to the site.</p>

                <h2>Non-Power Activities</h2>
                <p>In accordance with Executive Instrument (EI) 42, 1989, the VRA administers and exercises Local Authority functions in the Akosombo Township. It also manages and provides property, facility management, property development and security services the Akosombo township, the VRA community at Akuse and the Aboadze township. The Authority continues to provide and manage first and second cycle schools in Aboadze, Akosombo and Akuse. In addition, VRA provides health care services for staff, their dependents and local communities within its operational areas in Akosombo, Aboadze, Akuse and Accra.</p>
                <p>The VRA also carries out a dredging programme at the estuary of the Volta River at Ada to reduce the incidents of Bilharzia, and restore the ecosystem in the area. To ensure the sustainable management of the Akosombo and Kpong Dams, the Authority maintains an aquatic weed harvesting program, which aims at eliminating or reducing the prevalence of Bilharzia, improving the water quality, transforming the livelihoods of the riparian communities in the Lower Volta area and preserving of the ecosystem.</p>

                <h2>Climate Change Agenda</h2>
                <p>In response to the global clarion call for a cohesive approach to confronting the challenges of climate change, the VRA in its Renewable Energy Policy, has developed a <strong>Carbon Footprint Management Programme (CFMP)</strong>, which details planned actions towards pollution prevention, waste reduction and sustainable development. The CFMP has guided the development and introduction of climate-smart interventions in the operations of the Authority.</p>
                <p>Interventions such as the Volta Gorge Reforestation Programme, Climate Smart Stove Initiative and Corporate initiatives such as the Corporate Waste Segregation Programme and the use of less carbon-intensive fuels in generation activities have been implemented to reduce Greenhouse Gas emission levels of the Authority.</p>
                <p>The Authority, has since 2018, operated all its thermal plants on natural gas leading to significant reduction in carbon emissions. Two major tree-planting programmes, the Volta Gorge Reforestation Programme and the Buffer Zone Reforestation Programme, serving as carbon sinks, cover about <strong>5,300 Ha</strong> of land in and around the Volta Gorge Area and other parts of the Lake.</p>
                <p>In 2021, as part of Government's "Greening Ghana Project", the Authority collaborated with the Ministry of Lands and Natural Resources to plant <strong>600 tree seedlings</strong> across all work locations of the Authority. Internally, the Authority has initiated conscious actions to operate sustainably and reduce waste generation through its "Corporate Solid Waste Segregation Programme". The programme is aimed at separating solid wastes into its components at source to facilitate easy recycling. So far <strong>5.9 tons</strong> of Office Wastepaper has been transferred for recycling.</p>
                <p>The Authority has also incorporated in its workflow, innovations in ICT to ensure business continuity in a paper-less work environment. This includes the introduction of an Electronic Documents & Records Management System and substantial improvement in ICT infrastructure to meet changing trends in sustainable operations in the Energy Sector.</p>
                <p>There has also been a shift from the traditional reliance on firewood as domestic fuel with the introduction of fuel-efficient and energy saving improved cook stoves in 2016, termed as "Climate Smart Stoves" (CSS) in the riparian communities. This initiative, which is a collaborative action with the Fisheries Department in the Asuogyaman District has resulted in the construction of <strong>500 stoves</strong>. About <strong>1,000 stoves</strong> are expected to be constructed by 2024 in other districts.</p>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>
                <p>The Authority is also committed to ensuring that its operations and activities remain relevant, competitive and agile in the power sector. Key to the implementation of this strategy is the championing of viable solutions that ensure the strengthening of existing partnerships between the Authority and impacted communities within our areas of operation.</p>
                <h3>VRA Resettlement Trust Fund</h3>
                <p>In 1995, a combined effort between VRA and the Ghana Government realised the establishment of a special fund known as the <strong>VRA Resettlement Trust Fund</strong>, aimed at providing socio-economic interventions and economic empowerment solutions to <strong>52-resettlement townships</strong> as approved by the Managing Trustees. VRA continues to contribute annually an equivalent of <strong>five hundred thousand United States Dollars (US$500,000)</strong> to the fund towards poverty alleviation initiatives for the people living in the 52-resettlement townships.</p>
                <p>In addition to this fund, VRA has devoted extra resources to its CSR programme intended at improving standards of living through the provision of employability and entrepreneurial skills set to persons within the impacted communities. Thus, the Community Relations Unit was established in 2003 to endear a stable relationship with communities affected by the Authority’s operations and provide solutions to problems that were not catered for under the Resettlement Trust Fund.</p>
                
                <h3>Community Development Programme (CDP)</h3>
                <p>In 2012, VRA launched a CSR programme called the Community Development Programme (CDP) in communities impacted by its operations. The CDP represents a common ground for cooperation and partnership between VRA and the communities on the identification and provision of solutions to critical areas that stimulate economic and human capital development. The programme is also aimed at the development and implementation of social and economic activities in all communities and the transformation of these communities into 'opportunity communities'.</p>
                <p>The Authority has provided interventions in the areas of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Education:</strong> Scholarships and internship opportunities have been provided to needy but brilliant students of impacted communities. A total of <strong>449 students</strong> have so far benefited from the scholarship, which was instituted in 2011. The number comprises <strong>234</strong> at the Senior High School and <strong>215</strong> at the Tertiary level.</li>
                    <li><strong>Socio-Economic Empowerment:</strong> VRA in its efforts to support Communities affected by its operations in riparian areas, provides training in bee-keeping and fruit tree planting through its Poverty Alleviation Programme. As at 2020, the total number of installed bee hives increased from 124 in 2019 to <strong>134</strong> for about <strong>60 members</strong> of Community-Based Organisations in 5 impacted communities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sanitation:</strong> VRA has provided over <strong>90 biofil sanitation facilities</strong> in Central Tongu, South Tongu, Shama and Manya Krobo Districts. These facilities are part of preventive measures deployed towards disease eradication in communities along the Lower Volta Basin. Construction has also begun towards the provision of about <strong>40 biofil sanitation facilities</strong> for the Kade Government Hospital in the Kade District and some communities within the Authority’s operational areas. The Authority in collaboration with the Project Maji Foundation has provided solar-powered mechanized borehole water facilities in five communities. Marginal reductions have been recorded in the bilharzia prevalence rates in endemic communities along the Volta Basin due to the provision of the potable water and sanitation facilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disease Eradication:</strong> The Authority maintains collaborative efforts with the Asuogyaman District Health Management Team in the eradication of malaria, bilharzia and other water-borne diseases. These activities are guided by a Memorandum of Understanding that details plans for the eradication of Malaria with support from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Communication. The Authority also provided fumigation and disinfection services for five (5) communities and all work locations as part of efforts in the eradication of the COVID-19 virus.</li>
                    <li><strong>Public Health:</strong> The Authority through its Schistosomiasis Control Programme undertakes a Mass Drug Administration Programme frequently in communities along the Basin. Studies by the Ghana Health Service in 2018, showed a reduction in the prevalence levels of Urinary schistosomiasis over the previous year in forty-two (42) communities within six districts namely - South, North and Central Tongu, South Dayi, Ada East and Shai Osudoku districts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The VRA has earned an excellent reputation through its diverse CSR initiatives and activities, which has at its core the intense motivation to help the society while creating and enhancing business value, and increasing power generation through diversity to support the development of the Ghanaian economy. In 2020, the Authority was adjudged <strong>“CSR Company of the Year”</strong> at the prestigious Ghana Energy Awards. Ianmatsun Global Services Limited, organizers of the Sustainability and Social Investment Awards, also conferred on the Authority, Best Company in Clean Water Provision Project and Best Company in Project Providing Sanitation Facilities in 2020.</p>
